  <h3>Itroduction</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>The idea for this project came from <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript">The Odin Project</a>, although the original idea was to make a project that used pure Javascript, HTML and CSS, I wanted to practice using REACT.<p>
    <br>
  
  <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>In this projcet the next technologies were used: React, React libraries (gh-pages), Git (with Github), Ubuntu Linux operative system, VSCode, Javascript and CSS3. </p><br>
<br>

 <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>I consider that I undersatnd the basics of React and its adventages over making webapps using only JS, HTML and CSS; i.e. the rendering of components in the webpage is way easier using react, because we avoid direct DOM manipulation, besides that, React facilitates the data flow in the webpage creating a "state" (typically in one main component) which is like a central "database" that helps to make debugggin easier and avoid unexpected results. [*Note:<strong>I haven't learn using Redux with React yet</strong>]<p>
